### **System Performance Optimizer App - README.md**

---

## **Overview**

The **System Performance Optimizer** app is a powerful, all-in-one system monitoring, optimization, and security tool designed to help users enhance their computer's performance, streamline their workflow, and maintain system health. This desktop application is built using **Electron.js** and integrates a variety of features including real-time system diagnostics, AI-driven optimization recommendations, security checks, customizable user settings, and detailed reporting.

Whether you're a casual user wanting to maintain a smooth system, a power user managing resources efficiently, or a professional seeking to secure and optimize your PC, **System Performance Optimizer** has you covered.

## **Features**

- **Real-Time System Monitoring**  
  Monitor your system's performance in real-time, including CPU, RAM, disk, GPU usage, and network activity. Visualize your system's health with interactive graphs and performance overlays.

- **AI-Driven Recommendations**  
  Automatically receive suggestions based on system behavior. These recommendations help improve system performance, including closing unnecessary apps, updating drivers, and optimizing startup processes.

- **System Health Tracking & Trend Analysis**  
  Track your system's performance over time with trend analysis and heatmaps. Compare past system states, visualize performance degradation or improvement, and receive periodic health summaries.

- **Manual & Automated Optimization**  
  Run one-click optimizations to clean up temporary files, optimize startup programs, and reduce system clutter. Alternatively, schedule automatic optimizations for routine maintenance.

- **Security & Vulnerability Checks**  
  Scan your system for outdated software, security vulnerabilities, and weak configurations. Get actionable alerts and recommendations to enhance your system's security.

- **Process Management & Control**  
  Manage running processes by terminating, suspending, or prioritizing resource-heavy applications. Get insights into which processes are consuming the most resources and take control with ease.

- **Customizable Dashboard**  
  Personalize your experience by rearranging widgets, changing themes, and setting custom thresholds for performance alerts. The app is fully adaptable to suit your preferences.

- **Data Import/Export & Backup**  
  Export system reports and performance data for further analysis or sharing. Import settings from another device and restore backups of key configurations to avoid system reconfiguration.

- **Real-Time Performance Overlay**  
  An always-on overlay shows real-time performance metrics over other apps, providing continuous monitoring during tasks like gaming or video editing.

- **System Compatibility Check**  
  Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements to run the app with a pre-installation compatibility check.
